####### TASK 1: 0.5 points ################################

# 1.Create a sequence of 14 consecutive integers from 1 to 70, with steps of 5 (i.e., 1, 6, 11, â€¦)

intseqshireen <- seq(from=1,to=70,by=5)    #seq created from 1 to 70 by 5

# and create a matrix with 7 rows and 2 columns using this sequence. Fill the matrix by row.

matshireen <- matrix(intseqshireen, nrow = 7, ncol = 2,  byrow = TRUE)  #creating matrix and inputing data from seq, dim as proposed

# 2. Calculate the mean for all rows and the mean for all columns

meancshireen <- colMeans(matshireen)          #using colmeans to calculate mean for all rows and mean for all cols
meanrshireen <- rowMeans(matshireen)


# 3. Create a new matrix where together with numbers from the previous matrix, 'means' are displayed
# (under each column and after each row)

matB <- cbind(matshireen, meanrshireen)      #mean displayed under each row and after each col
matB                          
matA <- rbind(matshireen, meanrshireen)
matA




####### TASK 2: 0.5 points ################################
# 1. Create a matrix A with numbers 12, -14, 4.5, 7.5 in two columns and
# a matrix B with numbers -5, 14, 3.5, -8 in two columns.

matrixAShireen  <- c(12, -14, 4.5, 7.5)     #storing in vector
matrixBShireen  <- c(-5, 14, 3.5, 8)

MatrixAShireen <- matrix(matrixAShireen, 2, 2)         #creating matrix
MatrixBShireen <- matrix(matrixBShireen, 2, 2)

MatrixAShireen
MatrixBShireen

# 2. Find the sum of A and B matrices and store the results with comments on how the operation is conducted

Supermatrix <- MatrixAShireen + MatrixBShireen         #We can see that in addition to operation, the elements with the same index are added to each other.
#After addition, the dimension is also the same as it was, i.e., 3 rows and 3 columns
Supermatrix

# 3. Find the subtraction of A and B matrices and store the results with comments on how the operation is conducted

Weakmatrix <- MatrixAShireen - MatrixBShireen                 #same case explanaiton for subtraction
Weakmatrix  



# 4. Find the division of A to B matrices and store the results with comments on how the operation is conducted

Divmatrix <- MatrixAShireen/MatrixBShireen                     #same case explanaiton for div happening accoridng to index
Divmatrix
