####### TASK 1: 0.5 points ################################

# Store 'women' dataset from R into your environment and save it as a data frame
library(datasets)
library(help = "datasets")
data("women")

# Find information about this data set online or in R and briefly describe it
# Your answer:

# According to information found in rdocumentation.org, 'women' data set gives the 
# average heights and weights for American women aged 30-39.


####### TASK 2: 1 point ################################
# 1. Provide brief examination of the saved data set ('women'). Report your results.

# There are 15 observations and 2 columns named "height" and "weight". 

# 2. Convert height(inches) into height(cm) and weight(lbs) into weight(kg)
# and create a new data frame with 2 columns 'height.cm' and 'weight.kg'
# P.S. there are several ways to do it, here just use the mathematical way to calculate
# and convert inches into cm (1 inch = 2.54cm) and lbs into kg (1 lb = 0.45kg)

# I multiplied heights and weights accordingly
height.cm <- (women[,1]) * 2.54
height.cm
weight.kg <- (women[,2]) * 0.45
weight.kg

#Creating a new data frame with converted heights and weights with data.frame() function:
women2 <- data.frame(height.cm, weight.kg)

# 3. Create two histograms for height.cm and weight.cm, using hist() function

hist(height.cm)
hist(weight.kg)

# 4. Create two boxplots for height.cm and weight.cm, using boxplot() function

boxplot(height.cm)
boxplot(weight.kg)

# 5. Report standard deviation and variance for weight and height. 
# Interpret the results from the all the graphs and provide Exploratory Data Analysis.

# I got the standard deviation from the function sd() and variance from var(). I also calculated means with
# mean() function to compare it to variance. 
sd(height.cm)
sd(weight.kg)
var(height.cm)
var(weight.kg)
mean(height.cm)
mean(weight.kg)

# From the boxplots it is seen that height histogram has a normal distribution, whereas weight has a positively 
# skewed distribution. Histogram also shows that it's positively skewed.
# Variance for height is lower than the mean of height, which means that the data is not that spread out. 
# Same goes to weight. Standard deviation is lower for weight, and it is also observable on the histogram, as the 
# curve is not high. For height sd is higher, which can also be seen on the histogram, as the curve is higher. 


####### TASK 3: 0.5 points ################################

# Briefly, in your own words, describe the difference between a 'table' object and a 'data frame' in R.
# When is table() function used?
# P.S. do not confuse 'table' with 'data.table'

# Your answer: In data frames you can store different types of data in each column, like one column may be numeric
# and another logical. Tables are mainly used to organize categorical variables.
# table() is used to create a table in which you can add different variables. When the table is complete, 
# different types of data analysis can be done, like chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests. 


####### TASK 4: 1 point ################################

# The following data is available: 
# Thirty students took a test with the highest score 10 points. 
# Their results were as follows:
# 8, 9, 7, 3, 7, 7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 10, 7, 4, 7, 1, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 2, 8, 4, 6, 10, 7, 4, 2, 4, 9

# 1. Prepare a frequency table of the scores.

#Creating a frequency table with the table() function:
score <- c(8, 9, 7, 3, 7, 7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 10, 7, 4, 7, 1, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 2, 8, 4, 6, 10, 7, 4, 2, 4, 9)
freq <- table(score)

# 2. Calculate the mean, median and mode of the scores.

mean(score)
median(score)
mode(score)

# 3. Interpret these results, using boxplot() function.

boxplot(score)
# The boxplot shows that the distribution is negatively skewed, as the median is closer to the top of the box. 

# 4. Calculate the relative frequency of the scores 

# I can calculate the relative frequency of the scores by dividing the scores with the total number of values in the table:
rel <- table(score)/length(score)
# If we multiply the results with 100, we will get the percentages of the relative frequencies. 

# 5. Calculate cumulative frequency of the scores

# cumsum() function calculates the cumulative frequency:
cumul <- cumsum(table(score))

# 6. Finally, calculate the relative cumulative frequency of the scores

# Relative cumulative frequency can be calculated by dividing cumsum() with lenght(scores):
rel_cumul <- cumsum(table(score))/length(score)

# 7. Create a data frame with columns for 'score' / 'freq' / 'rel' / 'cumul' / rel_cumul
# to store all the frequency results

# I created a new data frame named df with the data.frame() function in which I added previously created data.
df <- data.frame(score, freq, rel, cumul, rel_cumul)
